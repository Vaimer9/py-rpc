# py-rpc
This is a python application that you can use to display discord RPC. It's main purpose was for the average joe to be able to use this with no past coding experience because the library used is very abstractive and usefull so i made the code json integrated

# How to use it
Open the config.json file in your notepad and edit the different values

# coming in future updates
The 2nd button isn't working and i know because I coded it so i will do it somewhere in the future which will not be that far out
