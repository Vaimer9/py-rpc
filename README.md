# py-rpc
This is a python application that you can use to display discord RPC. It's main purpose was for the average joe to be able to use this with no past coding experience because the library used is very abstractive and usefull so i made the code json integrated

# How to use it
Go to discord developer portal i.e https://discord.com/developers/applications and create an application and copy the application's APP ID and put it inside the config.json file. Not showing this key to others is recommended as they can use this key to change ur rpc according to will.
Open the config.json file in your notepad and edit the different values like state, detail etc

# How to get images
Go to Your application tab in discord dev portal and select Rich presence -> Assets, scroll down and upload the image you want (keep in mind the size limit of the file). Once that is done go to config.json and put the name of the image that you saved and enjoy the image!

# coming in future updates
The 2nd button isn't working and i know because I coded it so i will do it somewhere in the future which will not be that far out
